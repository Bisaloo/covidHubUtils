## covidHubUtils 0.1.1

This is a release focusing on new features in plotting functions. 

### Feature updates
- `plot_forecast()` now supports faceted plots of multiple models, locations and forecast dates for one target variable. 
  
  In `plot_forecast()`, `facet` and `facet_scales` are equivalent to `facets` and `scales` in `ggplot2::facet_wrap()`. `facet` takes facet formula, for example `facet = ~ model`. `facet_scales` are expecting the same values for `scales` in `ggplot2::facet_wrap()`, such as `"fixed"`, `"free_y"`, `"free_x"` or `"free"`.
  
  If `fill_by_model = TRUE`, each model will be represented by a unique color. If `fill_by model = FALSE`, all models and selected prediction intervals will be represented by blue colors.
  
  For simplicity, prediction interval legends will be grey in faceted plots. Morever, when the user selects more than 5 models, only 95% predicition interval is included. Otherwise, all selected prediction intervals will be plotted. 
  
### Package updates
- There is no backwards compatibility due to argument changes in `plot_forecast()`.
