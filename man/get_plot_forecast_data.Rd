\usage{
get_plot_forecast_data(
  forecast_data,
  truth_data = NULL,
  models_to_plot,
  forecast_dates_to_plot,
  horizons_to_plot,
  quantiles_to_plot,
  locations_to_plot,
  plot_truth = TRUE,
  truth_source,
  target_variable_to_plot,
  truth_as_of = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{forecast_data}{forecasts data frame from load_forecast().
It has columns model, forecast_date,location, target, type, quantile,
value, horizon and target_end_date.}

\item{truth_data}{optional data frame with forecasts in the format returned
by load_truth().}

\item{models_to_plot}{characters of model abbreviations}

\item{forecast_dates_to_plot}{date string vectors for forecast dates to plot.}

\item{horizons_to_plot}{forecasts are plotted for the horizon time steps after
the forecast date.}

\item{quantiles_to_plot}{vector of quanitles to include in the plot}

\item{locations_to_plot}{character vector of one location.}

\item{plot_truth}{boolean to indicate whether truth data should be plotted.
Default to TRUE.}

\item{truth_source}{character specifying where the truth data will
be loaded from if truth_data is not provided.
Otherwise, this character specifies the data source to plot.
Currently support "JHU","USAFacts" and "NYTimes".}

\item{target_variable_to_plot}{string specifying target type. It should be one of
"cum death", "inc case", "inc death" and "inc hosp"}

\item{truth_as_of}{the plot includes the truth data that would have been
in real time as of the truth_as_of date.}
}
\value{
data frame with columns model,
forecast_date, location,  target_variable, type, quantile, value, horizon and
target_end_date.
